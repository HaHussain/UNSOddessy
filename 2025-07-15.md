# Story

We'll be training at this centre, start after lunch.
We train hard and get to know eachother.

Two weeks before launch:

Told to go to Proxima Centauri

[[Malle Dange|Malle]]'s going to release an album released in space.

We went to the cavern to investigate,
Saw a spacesuit glove from a Qhon.
