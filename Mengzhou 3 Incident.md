2029: Mengzhou 3 lands at Shackleton Crater on the [[Moon]]. Chinese taikonauts discover a dormant extra-terrestrial vessel on the crater floor, which activates, leaves the crater, and fires upon [[Earth]]. In the next few minutes, every major space launch site and military base is destroyed. The taikonauts manage to board the vessel and destroy it, losing their lives in the process.

The remains of the vessel were taken down to [[Earth]] and examined. From the remains, the secret to interstellar flight was discovered: the [[Spike Drive]]. The beings who created the vessel are dubbed ‘[[Species X]]’. In light of the knowledge that humanity is not alone and the existence of at least one potentially hostile species, inter-state conflicts largely cease and there is an economic downturn in preparation for a future attack.
