*(He / Him)* [[Human]]
# Appearance
White American bald army man.

# History
General with the US (maybe marines or army?)

# Notes
US Navy wanted to donate to us a 8 warhead tactical nuke on our mission that we could use to destroy potential threats. [[UNSA]] required our consensus which we did not reach so we did not take the nuke.
Was very confident that the nuke wouldn't jeopardise the safety of the ship.
