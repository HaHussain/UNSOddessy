# Equipment: 
All armaments are stored entirely within the A.C.U to allow for instantaneous access at any moment that threats are present, and the most standard model includes a serrated combat knife and semi-automatic low calibre pistol. The A.C.U also has a drone that it can utilise for basic reconnaissance and tactical assessment.
