# Story

We meet at a conference centre at [[UNSA]].
We'll be training at this centre, start after lunch.
[[Camille 'Cami' Nangong|Cami]] gives [[Malle Dange|Malle]] a knitted hair braid.
[[Malle Dange|Malle]] says she will read [[Camille 'Cami' Nangong|Cami]]'s speculative fiction but gets an assistant to summarise it for her.
[[Colonel Suyin Song|Suyin]] accidentally steals [[Camille 'Cami' Nangong|Cami]]'s JellyCat bunny.
We train hard and get to know eachother a bit but don't really make friends.

Two weeks before launch:
JellyCat bunny is returned to [[Camille 'Cami' Nangong|Cami]] but has gone through the wash a couple times :(.
[[General Miller]] gives us all a transparent key. The US has given us each a key to a Trident Missile that should be used on anything that could endanger Earth. [[UNSA]] required this to have consensus from [[#The Crew]] but it was not reached so was not donated.

Told to go to [[Proxima Centauri]]
Mishap on the first piloting check by [[Camille 'Cami' Nangong|Cami]] 

In Metadimensional space travel, we see objects moving in two dimensional time, and see 3d objects from in and out, we spend 6 days in the time. Spend 14 more days before getting out.
Get to [[Proxima Centauri]] and there's nothing there but a barren rock.

Long range radio signal on [[Proxima Centauri#Proxima Centauri b|Proxima Centauri b]] coming from underground. [[Malle Dange|Malle]] is able to decode it with the help of [[Camille 'Cami' Nangong|Cami]] and [[Dr Andrea Jones|Andrea]]. We send a message, 'Bonjour' and are able to get a response that is a single set of co-ordinates depicted underground. 

We go through tunnels and find metal tunnels going deeper. Humanoid, tall 7ft, long limbs. Weapons. Space suits which implies they are not native to [[Proxima Centauri#Proxima Centauri b|Proxima Centauri b]].
Life on the first solar system [[The UNS Oddessy]] went to, implies an abundance of extra-terrestrial life.

We have attempted to communicate to them. Send Aricebo message, figuring out yes or no. They are called [[Qhon]], they tell us 'Danger''. They were originally 10 but now 7. Ask us for help. They were dropped off here and the ship will come back in 3 years and some went down and didn't come back. 
They've been listening to our TV.
They've heard [[Malle Dange|Malle]]'s music, they don't particular like it.
We're going to write them a song.
[[Malle Dange|Malle]]'s going to release an album released in space.

We went to the cavern to investigate,
Saw a spacesuit glove from a [[Qhon]] that went missing. 
Found the [[Qhon]]'s rifle but it was marked in corrosive marks.
Saw a weird 8 legged creature on the ceiling that dropped on the [[Qhon]] with us and...
