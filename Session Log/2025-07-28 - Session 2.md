[[Chip Dawson|Chip]] was able to kill one spider but two more drop from the ceiling.
[[Camille 'Cami' Nangong|Cami]] killed a spider.
[[Kindness|Qhon Guard 2]] was hit, their space suit was held together telekinetically by [[Malle Dange|Malle]], patched by [[Rain|Qhon Guard 1]] and then they were healed by [[Dr Andrea Jones|Andrea]].
Last Spider was killed by [[A.C.U. Automated Combat Unit|ACU]].

[[Champagne|Qhon Scientist]] asked [[Dr Andrea Jones|Andrea]] how she got her psychic powers and was confused.
[[Colonel Suyin Song]] contacts us and we debrief.
We enter the Research station the [[Qhon]] have set up on [[Proxima Centauri]], they want to stay here so we give them a couple weapons. We explain to them the [[Mengzhou 3 Incident]] and they were confused and how quickly we innovated. They have no Ansible. They do not what [[Species X]] are. The [[Qhon]] are from a long way away, their home planet is on [[Denebola]]. 

[[AD Leo]] is called [[Haven]] and its where lots of species congregate, its a good place to go for trading.
They're happy to give us some star charts for some ammo and guns.
They have a translation schema for [[Qhon]] to [[Sofian]] which is the local language of the sector. They are able to give that to us.
They hand over a disc that has a hologram message that says in [[Qhon]] that we have helped them and we should show it to any other [[Qhon]] we meet.
We ask for their wikipedia, and they give it to us in [[Qhon]]. We should send it to [[Earth]] and [[UNSA]] to decode it and learn from it.
We get [[Champagne]]'s music collection and they get [[Malle Dange|Malle]]'s music collection and [[Camille 'Cami' Nangong|Cami]]'s fanfics.

[[Colonel Suyin Song]] cooks up a nice curry.

[[Proxima Centauri#Proxima Centauri b|Proxima Centauri b]] is interesting to the [[Qhon]] because it seems to have a underground ecosystem even without an atmosphere.

We spend a rest at [[Proxima Centauri]] talking to the [[Qhon]] and leave on June 10th 2035.
Then set off to [[Alpha Centauri]] spending 6 days getting there, 4 days refuelling [[The UNS Oddessy]] with the Fuel Scoops.
[[Alpha Centauri]] has lifeless planets. Boring.

Start clocks on decoding [[Qhon]] database and making a song for the [[Qhon]].
Both checks fail.
Spend 6 days getting to Sirius, nothing interesting.
Spend 6 days getting to Lacaille 9352, nothing interesting, 4 days refuelling.
Fails on both clocks again.
Spend 6 days getting to Gliese 860, find a bunch of satellites around the star.
Spend 6 days getting to [[AD Leo]], arriving on the 18th of July 2035.

A number of space stations around [[AD Leo]], a small red dwarf star. 
We are contacted in [[Sofian]] and we are directed to station called High Haven 2, it is run by Haven Transit Authority
They get annoyed we haven't replied.
We reply and we dock with them, they want to inspect our ship.
We find some [[Alsafins|humanoid Ape aliens]] and they congratulate us on the [[Spike Drive]].
Docking 500 Alterian Credits.

We split into two groups [[Malle Dange]], [[Camille 'Cami' Nangong|Cami]] and [[A.C.U. Automated Combat Unit|ACU]] head to the club, and don't get in.
[[Kelechi]], [[Chip Dawson|Chip]], and [[Dr Andrea Jones|Andrea]] head to sell stuff, they bump into a hairless humanoid with soft clay like features called [[Centash]] who is [[Sofian]] who's interested in the new people in the sector, and specifically spices and titties.
