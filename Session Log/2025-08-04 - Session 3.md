We start on [[Haven]].
[[Centash]] thinks [[Wolf 294]] has a [[Sofian]] research institute which probably has information on [[Species X]]. Working with [[Sofian]] homeworld.
[[Centash]] is willing to set-up access in return for a trade post in [[Earth|Sol]].
[[Centash]]'s office is on High [[Haven]] 2

[[Malle Dange|Malle]] and [[Camille 'Cami' Nangong|Cami]] performed on High [[Haven]] 2 earning 150 Alterian credits.
3 Scaly shiny fish humanoid aliens with lots of symbols approach us. The main scaly shiny fish guy is called [[Nashask]]
The [[Phovon Republic]] are interested in us and want to move us to the [[Phovon Republic]] Sector.
They bring us to a security room with lots of screens of cameras. 
This station has garrisons of [[Phovon Republic]] and [[Sofian Empire]]
They say don't trust the [[Sofian Empire]].
They have an Military Intelligence post at [[HL4]] and if they've seen anything like that they might have info there. They have been denied access to a memorial, by the [[Sofian Empire]], of a shared struggle of their two people, in [[Alsafines]]. They want us to go to [[HL4]] then pick a couple of them up and take them to [[Alsafi]].
They will pay the docking fee for us. They gave us 512 Alterian credits instead.

The [[Sauhax Ascendancy]] once took over this sector and a few other sectors happened 300 years ago. [[Sofian]]s had to fight to take back the region from them.
Per [[Centash]], the [[Phovon]]s don't like the [[Sofian]]s for reasons unclear to the [[Sofian]]s. The [[Phovon]]s were occupied by the [[Sauhax Ascendancy]]. The [[Phovon]]s allied with [[Sofian]]s against [[Sauhax]],  but in the intervening centuries since the peace, the [[Phovon]]s have come to distrust the [[Sofian]]s, and the [[Sofian]]s have been upset by consequent reduced trade.
[[Centash]] gives the vibe that this is a sensitive issue, and would be reluctant to say more on the matter.

Per [[Centash]], [[Phovon]]s and [[Sofian]]s as liberators of the sector often each have a garrison on spots in the sector. Where one places a garrison, the other will surely follow. [[Sauhax]] reverse engineered tech traded with them and decided they didn't want to freely share the sector and instead would take it all for themselves, and they started a crusade against everyone. They advanced quickly despite being less technologically advanced. A spiritual aspect to their drive for conquest they took over this sector, parts of [[Sofian]] and [[Phovon]] sectors. After the [[Sauhax]] kerfuffle, decided trade only permissible with low conflict  civilisations who have independently developed the [[Spike Drive]].
